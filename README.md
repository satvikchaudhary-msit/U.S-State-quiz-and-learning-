# U.S-State-quiz-and-learning-

This quiz has been developed using pandas and turtle libraries.
It is a quiz where user inputs names of various states if they've choosed a right state of U.S then the name of the state will be placed on the map inside the screen.
There are total 50 states in United States of America.If you're able to completely fill the map then it's amazing but still if you don't manage to complete all 50 states then you can see and learn all the states you missed in a separate CSV file named "missing_state.csv" to learn all the states.
GO AHEAD AND ENJOY THE QUIZ.
